# Tech-Sales-Data-Analysis
An overseas tech sales outlet wants to know how they have performed over the past year. They wanted to know which times of the day sales and orders were at their
highest to inform marketing and advertisement decisions.

As the data analyst, I was tasked with providing key metrics such as 
  1. The total revenue for the season
  2. The Top selling products
  3. The most lucrative cities to sell in
  4. The maximum sales per time

I used excel to compile the data and powerBI to carry out the analyses and design the dashboard. I also provided a brief summary of key metrics for the stakeholders.
